# https://github.com/p8952/bocker#prerequisites

# Prerequisites

# THe following packages are needed to run bocker.
# * btrfs-progs
# * curl 
# * iproute2
# * iptables
# * libcgroup-tools
# util-linux >= 2.25.2
# coreutils >= 7.5

# Because most distributions do not ship a new enough version of util-linux
# you will probably need to grab the source from here and compile it yourself.
# https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.25/

# Additionally your system will need to be configured with the following:
# * Abtrfs filesystem mounted under /var/bocker
# * A network bidge called bridge0 and an IP of 10.0.0.1/24
# * IP forwarding enabled in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# * A firewall routing traffic from bridge0 to a physical interface
